# 🌍 AQI Predictor: Time Series-Based Air Quality Forecasting  

**AQI Predictor** is a machine learning model designed to **analyze and predict air quality index (AQI) trends** using **time series forecasting techniques**. It helps in identifying air pollution patterns, enabling better planning and awareness for environmental and health concerns.  

## 📊 Overview  

This project leverages **time series analysis** to predict AQI values based on historical air quality data. The model can be used to:  
- Forecast **future AQI levels** for different locations.  
- Detect **seasonal and long-term trends** in air pollution.  
- Provide **early warnings** for areas experiencing high pollution levels.  

## 🚀 Key Features  

✅ **Data Preprocessing & Analysis** – Handles missing values, outliers, and normalizes AQI data for accurate predictions.  

✅ **Time Series Forecasting Models**:  
   - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** – Captures trends, seasonality, and stationarity in AQI data.  
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)** – Uses deep learning to model complex temporal dependencies.  
   - **Prophet Model** – A robust model for forecasting AQI with trend and seasonality decomposition.  

✅ **Visualization & Insights** – Generates **interactive plots** to display AQI trends and model performance.  

✅ **Real-Time AQI Updates** – Can be integrated with APIs to fetch live air quality data and improve predictions.
